# Data Management System

:::callout ðŸš§ Feature under development
The data management system is under development. Not all use cases are covered by the initial release. You can provide feedback about desired functionality on the [Strapi feedback website](https://feedback.strapi.io). Significant releases for this feature include:

- v4.6.0: Data export and Data import,
- Beta release: Data transfer.

:::

Occasionally you need to move data out of or into a Strapi instance. The data management system allows you to efficiently extract data from an existing instance or archive and import that data into a separate instance. Additionally, the data management system allows you to transfer data between a local Strapi instance and a remote Strapi instance. Strapi provides CLI-based commands that allow you to export, import, and transfer data. Common use cases include:

- Use [`strapi export`](/dev-docs/data-management/export) to create a data backup.
- Use [`strapi import`](/dev-docs/data-management/import) to restore data from a backup.
- Use [`strapi transfer`](/dev-docs/data-management/transfer) to transfer data from a local to a remote instance.

The following documentation details examples of how to use the [`strapi export`](/dev-docs/data-management/export), [`strapi import`](/dev-docs/data-management/import), and [`strapi transfer`](/dev-docs/data-management/transfer) commands.

:::strapi Command Line Interface (CLI) shortcut
If you want to skip the details and examples the `strapi export`, `strapi import`, and `strapi tranfer` CLI commands with all of the available options are documented in the [Command Line Interface documentation](/dev-docs/cli#strapi-export).
:::

:::caution
Interactive CLI commands do not currently work with the `npm` package manager. For `strapi export` and `strapi import` this means the encryption key prompt is not visible in the CLI. A fix is anticipated by early March 2023. In the meantime consider using the `yarn` package manager.
